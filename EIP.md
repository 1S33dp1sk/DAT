title: Decentralized Autonomous Treasury Standard
author: Karam Jaber <mrkj@d-cloud.io>
type: Standards Track
category: ERC
status: Draft
created: Jan 12th 2024

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for a Decentralized Autonomous Treasury (DAT) that manages financial operations involving ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in a blockchain-based ecosystem.

## Abstract

This standard defines functionalities for a Decentralized Autonomous Treasury that handles issuance, redemption, and management of both fungible (ERC20) and non-fungible tokens (ERC721). It provides a robust framework for managing bonds, premiums, and token trading within a unified financial ecosystem.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this standard is to create a unified and standardized approach for a treasury system that integrates both fungible and non-fungible token assets. This standard facilitates the development of decentralized financial applications that can interact seamlessly with a wide range of financial instruments.

## Specification

### DAT Functions

#### MintBond

``` js
function MintBond() external returns (uint256 bondId);
```

Issues a new ERC721 bond in exchange for Ether. The bond is minted with specific attributes such as purchase price and monthly premium.
IssueBond

``` js
function IssueBond() external returns (uint256 bondId);
```

Allows a user to issue a bond by redeeming a specific amount of ERC20 tokens. The bond is issued with attributes that define its financial terms and conditions.
DefaultBond

``` js
function DefaultBond(uint256 bondId) external;
```
Enables bondholders to default on their bond and receive compensation based on the bond's terms. This function handles the logistics and financial calculations for the defaulting process.
BondPremium

``` js
function BondPremium(uint256 bondId) external;
```

Pays out the monthly premium for a bond to the bond owner. This function calculates the interest based on the bond's monthly premium and ensures the payout does not exceed the compensation limits.
TokenBuy

``` js
function TokenBuy() external payable returns (uint256 tokensBought);
```

Allows users to buy ERC20 tokens in exchange for Ether. The function includes mechanisms for price determination and transfer of tokens.
TokenSell

``` js
function TokenSell(uint256 tokenAmount) external returns (uint256 etherReceived);
```

Enables users to sell ERC20 tokens in exchange for Ether. This function handles the token-to-Ether exchange process and calculates the corresponding Ether amount.
Events
BondIssued

``` js
event BondIssued(address indexed issuer, address indexed recipient, uint256 indexed bondId, uint256 bondPrice, uint256 issueTime, uint256 totalBondsIssued);
```

Triggered when a new bond is issued, providing transparency and details about the bond issuance.
BondCompensated

``` js
event BondCompensated(address indexed owner, uint256 indexed bondId, uint256 compensationAmount, uint256 compensatedAt);
```

Occurs when a bond's premium or compensation is paid out, detailing the amount and timing of the payout.
Implementation

The DAT functionalities are implemented through a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The implementation ensures security, efficiency, and compliance with the Ethereum network's standards. Example implementations and further details can be found at [[GitHub repository link](https://github.com/1S33dp1sk/DAT)].
Security Considerations

    The DAT contracts include mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks and ensure that all state changes happen atomically.
    Rigorous testing, including unit and integration tests, is performed to ensure the contract's resilience against common vulnerabilities.
    Smart contract audit by a reputable firm is recommended before deploying the DAT in a production environment.

History

    The DAT concept was developed to address the need for a versatile and integrated treasury system within the Ethereum ecosystem.
    Discussions and contributions from various community members and stakeholders have shaped the development of this standard.
